instant codegen demo with gpt-oss, cerebras, and bun

TODO:

- Store generated code? (on InstantDB?)
- Deploy (to Fly or Render?)

Principles:

- When codegen is instant, what does that unlock?
  - metaphor: swimming through possibility-space of frontends
  - generation is cheap, human validation is expensive
  - if the output is bad, rewrite or retry rather than iterate?
